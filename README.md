This is my submission for the decoder ring project, to which I may add more features over time.

Currently has:

 - -Caesar Cipher

   --Both encoding and decoding, with user assigned shifts.
   
 

 - -Polybius Squares

   --Both encoding and decoding.
   
 

 - -Substitution

   --Both encoding and decoding!
   
   ---4/14/2022: Added random alphabet generation! Simply leave the alphabet section blank,
              and it will generate one randomly! Only uses a-z characters though, so if
              you want to use special characters you'll have to input an alphabet using
              them.
              
 

 - -Base64

   --Encoding, decoding, and displaying images!
   
   ---Simply select display image and input the base64 code for an image,
   and it'll display said image! A site for converting images is linked
   on the actual page.
    
  Todo, if I ever actually decide to do it:

 - Binary
 - Hex
 - Morse

   find other ciphers :/
